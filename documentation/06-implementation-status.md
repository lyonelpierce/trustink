   - Cannot handle complex layouts or tables

2. **AI Capability**
   - Mock responses don't provide true document insights
   - Limited understanding of complex legal concepts
   - No true learning from user interactions

3. **Performance**
   - Large documents may cause performance issues
   - No document caching implemented
   - Limited optimization for repeated operations

### User Experience Limitations

1. **Revision Management**
   - Basic interface for managing multiple revisions
   - Limited conflict resolution for competing changes
   - No diff visualization for complex changes

2. **Collaboration**

   - Basic sharing model with limited permissions
   - No commenting on specific sections

3. **Document Editing**
   - Basic text editing capabilities
   - No rich text formatting
   - Limited support for images or tables
