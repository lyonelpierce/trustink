## Technology Integration Plan

### ElevenLabs Integration

The integration with ElevenLabs Conversational AI will replace the current Web Speech API implementation to provide higher quality voice interaction:

1. **Phase 1: ElevenLabs Setup**
   - Create ElevenLabs account and obtain API keys
   - Configure agent in ElevenLabs Conversational AI platform
   - Set up Together AI integration with Llama 3.1
   - Create secure API routes for ElevenLabs communication

2. **Phase 2: Frontend Integration**
   - Implement `@11labs/react` package
   - Create conversation state management
   - Build document context formation utilities
   - Develop enhanced UI for voice interactions

3. **Phase 3: Testing & Refinement**
   - Test with various documents and queries
   - Optimize document context for LLM understanding
   - Refine section highlighting accuracy
   - Measure conversation quality and performance

For detailed technical information, see the [ElevenLabs and Together AI Integration](./elevenlabs-llm-integration.md) document.

### Testing Strategy

We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy for the voice assistant functionality:

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test individual components and hooks
   - Mock ElevenLabs API responses
   - Test document context formation

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test communication between frontend and API routes
   - Verify proper error handling
   - Test document context integration

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete voice interaction flows
   - Verify document context is properly incorporated
   - Test with various document types

For detailed testing information, see the [Voice Assistant Testing Strategy](./voice-assistant-testing.md) document.
