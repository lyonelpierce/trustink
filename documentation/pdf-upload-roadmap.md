   - Basic highlighting is implemented
   - Need to enhance with proper linking to AI context

### What's Missing ❌

1. **Advanced PDF Text Extraction**
   - Need to implement proper text extraction from PDF files
   - Section identification based on document structure
   - Content parsing for meaningful sections

2. **Real AI Integration**
   - Replace mock AI responses with actual LLM calls
   - Implement context-aware document analysis
   - Enable interactive editing suggestions

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling for file processing failures
   - Retry mechanisms for uploads and downloads
   - User-friendly error messages

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete PDF Upload and Storage

1. **Enhance Document Upload Component**
   - Add validation for file size and type
   - Improve error handling for upload failures
   - Add progress tracking for large files

2. **Improve Supabase Integration**
   - Implement better file naming strategy
   - Add versioning capability for documents
   - Ensure proper cleanup of storage for deleted documents

3. **Document API Improvements**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed documents
   - Implement pagination for document lists
   - Add sorting and filtering options

### Phase 2: Advanced Text Extraction

1. **PDF Text Extraction Library**
   - Evaluate and integrate a more robust PDF text extraction library (pdf.js, pdfminer)
   - Extract actual text content from PDF documents
   - Preserve text formatting where possible

2. **Intelligent Section Detection**
   - Implement algorithms to detect document sections based on:
     - Headings and font sizes
     - Page breaks and formatting changes
     - Content semantics (for legal documents)
   - Create a more structured section model

3. **Document Structure Analysis**
   - Identify document type (contract, agreement, etc.)
   - Detect common sections (e.g., termination clauses, payment terms)
   - Extract metadata like dates, parties, and values

### Phase 3: AI Integration

1. **LLM Integration**
   - Connect to OpenAI/Claude API for document analysis
   - Implement context management for document discussions
   - Create prompt templates for common document queries

2. **Document Understanding**
   - Train or fine-tune models for legal document analysis
   - Implement risk assessment for contracts
   - Enable summarization and simplification

3. **Interactive Editing**
   - Allow AI to suggest specific edits to document sections
   - Implement approval/rejection workflow for suggestions
   - Track edit history and rationales

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **DocumentUploader Component**
   - Test file selection and validation
   - Test drag and drop functionality
   - Test error handling for invalid files

2. **API Routes**
   - Test document upload endpoint with mock files
   - Test analysis endpoint with different query types
   - Test error handling for edge cases

3. **Text Extraction**
   - Test PDF parsing with various document formats
   - Test section extraction accuracy
   - Test handling of corrupt or invalid PDFs

### Integration Tests

1. **Upload to View Flow**
   - Test complete flow from upload to document viewing
   - Verify document metadata is correctly stored
   - Verify sections are properly extracted and displayed

2. **Document Analysis Flow**
   - Test document analysis requests and responses
   - Verify AI suggestions are properly rendered
   - Test revision creation and management

3. **Supabase Integration**
   - Test correct storage and retrieval of documents
   - Test permissions and access control
   - Test cleanup of resources on document deletion

### Performance Tests

1. **Large Document Handling**
   - Test upload and processing of large PDFs (10MB+)
   - Measure processing time for complex documents
   - Optimize for both performance and accuracy

2. **Concurrent Uploads**
   - Test system under multiple simultaneous uploads
   - Verify rate limiting and queue management
   - Ensure stability under load
